Recent graduate of Makers Academy, one of Europeâ€™s most selective web development boot-camps, currently seeking a meaningful full-stack developer role. Prior to the completion of this course I gained an analytical mindset and a high attention to detail through a career in science; skills that I now bring to the code that I write. I am looking to immerse myself in the development community and continue to learn, develop and contribute.

## <a name="skills">Skills</a>

#### Technical

* **Test Driven Development -** Passionate about TDD, I have seen its benefits first hand and the issues that result from not using it.


* **Quick Study -** An ability to learn new technologies quickly. From my time at Makers Academy I have developed a set of skills that allow me to pick up new languages and processes quickly, meaning I can hit the ground running.

* **Best Practices -** I strongly believe in the benefits of using Robert C. Martin's S.O.L.I.D principals when designing and writing code. Clean, reproducible and easily extendable code is what I strive towards.

* **Technologies -** Documented experience working with a variety of languages and stacks. Principally Ruby, Rails, PostgreSQL, React JS, Node JS and MongoDB. Please see my Projects section for examples.

#### Transferable

* **Attention to Detail -** An absolute requirement in my three years as a Laboratory Scientist to ensure accurate, reliable results and successful procedures that can be utilised by others. Specifically the microscopic manipulation of mouse embryos.

* **Passion for Learning -** I love learning, it is one of the reasons I initially became a biologist, and the reason I chose to transition to web development. You can never know it all, or enough.

* **Proactive -** At The Francis Crick Institute I conceived, developed and implemented a service for tracking the microbial gut populations of laboratory mice through gene sequencing. This required significant self-study and collaboration with resident bioinformaticians.

* **Team Player -** From working in bars, managing volunteers on a farm and being part of a small laboratory service department I appreciate the importance of, and enjoy working as part of a team. Efficient teamwork increases efficiency and quality of output, it's also fun!
